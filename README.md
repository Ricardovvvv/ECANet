# ECANet
The official implementation of "ECANet:An External-Class-Aware Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation of Street Scenes"

# Highlights
![](figs/performance.png)
<p align="center">Comparison of inference speed and accuracy for real-time models on test set of Cityscapes.</p>

* **External Class Features**: We propose a novel dual-branch network framework, ECANet, which, for the first time, introduces external class features to guide pixel classification, achieving
high-quality real-time segmentation.
* **More Accurate and Faster**: ECANet-S achieves 77.8% mIoU with speed of 94.1
FPS, ECANet-M achieves 80% mIoU with speed
of 63.2 FPS, and ECANet-L achieves 80.4% mIoU with speed
of 39.6 FPS.
* **Efficient Modules**: The novel and efficient modulesâ€”SPPFFM, SPCFFM, and DPPM are introduced and can significantly enhance the accuracy of ECANet.

# Prerequisites
This implementation is based on [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation). Please refer to their repository for installation and dataset preparation. The inference speed is tested on single RTX 3090 using the method introduced by [DDRNet](https://github.com/ydhongHIT/DDRNet). 

# Acknowledgement
* Our implementation is modified based on [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation).
* Latency measurement code is borrowed from the [DDRNet](https://github.com/ydhongHIT/DDRNet).
* Thanks for their nice contribution.
